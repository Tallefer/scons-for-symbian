#summary Instructions to install Scons for Symbian

=== Install [http://www.scons.org/ SCons]. ===
I used
{{{
 easy_install scons
}}}
At least SCons 0.98.5 did not install properly so you most likely need to copy the SCons folder from Python25\Lib\site-packages\scons-0.98.5-py2.5-win32.egg\scons-0.98.5 to Python25\Lib\site-packages\. After that you should have SCons folder under site-packages folder.

  * Create 'scons_symbian' folder to 'Python25\Lib\site-packages\'
  * Check out the source there
    * Follow the non-members' checkout instructions under [http://code.google.com/p/scons-for-symbian/source/checkout Source] tab.

And you should be good to go.
