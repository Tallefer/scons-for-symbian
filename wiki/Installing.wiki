#summary Instructions to install Scons for Symbian

==== Install [http://www.scons.org/ SCons]. ====
I used
 easy_install scons

At least SCons 0.98.5 did not install properly so you most likely need to copy the SCons folder from:
 Python25\Lib\site-packages\scons-0.98.5-py2.5-win32.egg\scons-0.98.5
to
 Python25\Lib\site-packages\ 

After that you should have SCons folder under site-packages.
Also remember to check that you have Python25\Scripts folder in your PATH.

==== Get sources ====
  * Create 'scons_symbian' folder to 'Python25\Lib\site-packages\'
  * Check out the project to the created folder
    * Follow the non-members' checkout instructions under [http://code.google.com/p/scons-for-symbian/source/checkout Source] tab.

And you should be good to go.

==== Install Ensymble ( Optional ) ====

If you want scons-for-symbian to handle your sis creation needs, install [http://www.nbl.fi/~nbl928/ensymble.html Ensymble]. Get the source package, *DO NOT* get a pre-squeezed version.
  * Unpack the archive
  * Create 'ensymble' folder to 'Python25\Lib\site-packages\'
  * Put the ensymble files there
  * Add __init__.py file to allow importing ensymble.
  * Get the openssl stuff mentioned in the Ensymble readme and put 'em in your PATH.
Just to be sure. Start python interpreter and try to import ensymble.
